Patient information: First Name, Last Name
    - create patient
    - select and update patient? is update for check in/out?

Dropdown feature: check in green /check out red
    - gotta change state, update color, have it stay 


use createRoot

Figure out port for express vs react, backend port should match proxy 

create src folder 
    - index.js in react entry point (webpack.config)
    
index.html is my HTML template for webpack in root 

extend react with components and manage your state with useState and useEffect

Setup mongodb and database

Stretch:
Add patients to calendar and time slots
Click on patient to view their profile/history

Front end - add calendar 1 week M - F, has hours from 12 - 2pm
theres a create patient with first name last name and date/time of appointment
theres a function that pulls/finds existing patients and schedules them for a certain date/time for appointment
it will then fill calendar
then that will have a drop down of check in / out 

maybe add a cancel appointment feature that will remove them from calendar
